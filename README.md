# Count-transcription-factors

This python script was used for my computational thesis project.
My data looked like this:

(For gene 1) TF1  TF2 TF3 .. TFN
.
.
(For gene X) TF1  TF2 TF3 .. TFN

The script will count how many times a TF is repeated in the file,
using the separator of our choice for distinguishing the words.
Î¤his way I compared the number of TFs in 2 different conditions and applied statistical tests on them.
